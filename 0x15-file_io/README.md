Introduction to File I/O in C

File input/output (I/O) is an essential aspect of programming in the C language, enabling the reading from and writing to files stored on a computer's storage. Manipulating files through I/O operations is crucial for tasks like data persistence, data processing, configuration management, and more.

C provides a set of standard functions and libraries specifically designed for file I/O operations. These functions allow programmers to interact with files by opening them, reading data from them, writing data to them, and closing them when finished. Understanding file I/O in C is fundamental for developing programs that require data exchange with external files.

In this guide, we will explore the basic concepts of file I/O in C and cover the essential functions required to perform file operations. We will delve into both text-based and binary file handling, as C supports both formats.

File I/O in C involves three fundamental steps: opening a file, performing read or write operations, and finally, closing the file. The "stdio.h" header file provides the necessary functions and macros for file I/O, including the commonly used functions such as fopen(), fclose(), fread(), fwrite(), fprintf(), fscanf(), and more.

When opening a file, C offers several modes that define how the file will be accessed. Modes include read ("r"), write ("w"), append ("a"), and more. These modes determine whether the file is opened for reading, writing, or both. Additionally, C allows for binary ("b") or text ("t") modes, enabling the handling of files containing binary data or text respectively.

Reading data from a file involves using functions like fscanf(), fgets(), or fread() to retrieve data from the file and store it in variables or arrays in memory for further processing. Conversely, writing data to a file is achieved through functions like fprintf(), fputs(), or fwrite() which allow us to write data from variables or arrays to the file.

Closing a file is an important step as it releases system resources associated with the file. The fclose() function is used to close an open file, ensuring that any changes made to the file are saved and freeing up system resources for other operations.

File I/O in C provides a powerful and flexible mechanism for working with external files. Whether it's reading configuration files, processing large datasets, or creating and modifying files, understanding file I/O is crucial for many practical programming scenarios.

In the upcoming sections, we will explore each step of file I/O in detail, examining the various functions, modes, and techniques for reading from and writing to files in the C programming language.

## project task

Task 0: Write a function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.

Task 1: Create a function that creates a file.

Task 2: Write a function that appends text at the end of a file.

Task 3: Write a program that copies the content of a file to another file.

Task 4: Write a program that displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file.
