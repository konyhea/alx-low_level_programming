# 0x18. C - Dynamic libraries

----------------------------

Dynamic libraries, also known as shared libraries, are collections of code and data that can be utilized by multiple programs simultaneously. Unlike static libraries, which are linked to a program at compile time, dynamic libraries are linked at runtime, allowing for more efficient memory usage and easier updates. They facilitate modular programming, reduce duplication of code, and enhance system flexibility. Dynamic libraries promote code reuse and enable developers to create more maintainable and scalable software systems.
