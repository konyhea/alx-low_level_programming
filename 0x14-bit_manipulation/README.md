#introduction

Bit manipulation is the process of manipulating individual bits or groups of bits within a binary number. This involves using logical, arithmetic, and bitwise operators to perform operations such as shifting, masking, setting, and clearing specific bits within a number. Bit manipulation is commonly used in computer programming to optimize memory usage, improve performance, and work with low-level hardware interfaces. It is also used in encryption algorithms and digital signal processing applications. Understanding bit manipulation can be essential for developing efficient and optimized code in fields such as software development, data science, and computer engineering.

## project Tasks

Task 0 : Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

Task 1 : Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

Task 2 : Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

Task 3 : Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

Task 4 : Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

Task 5 : Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

Task 6 : Write a function that checks the endianness.

Task 7 : Find the password for this program.
