#introduction to Singly Linked Lists
A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list. The first node is called the head, and the last node is called the tail, where the tail node's next reference is usually null. Singly linked lists are commonly used in computer science for their efficiency in insertions and deletions at the head of the list, as well as for their ability to represent dynamic structures such as stacks and queues. However, their main disadvantage is their lack of direct access to the previous node, making it difficult to traverse the list in reverse order or perform operations on the last node without traversing the entire list.

## Tasks for this projects

Task 0: Print List

Task 1: Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.

Task 2: Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.

Task 3: Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.

Task 4: Write a function that frees a list_t list.

Task 5: Write a function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.

Task 6: Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.
