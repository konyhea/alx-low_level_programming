# 0x1C. C - Makefiles
A Makefile is a script written in a special syntax that tells the make tool how to build a program or library from source code, specifying the dependencies between files, compilation and linking commands, and other rules to manage the build process. It features targets, dependencies, rules, variables, and pattern rules, automating the build process, managing complex dependencies, and allowing for flexible and customizable builds. Makefiles are commonly used for building executables from C/C++ source code, creating libraries from object files, managing complex projects with multiple dependencies, and automating the build process for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), ultimately saving time and effort.
