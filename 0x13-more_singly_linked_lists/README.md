#Introduction

A singly linked list is a data structure used in computer science to store and manage a collection of elements. It is composed of a sequence of nodes, each containing a data value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The first node is called the head of the list, and the last node's next pointer is set to null to indicate the end of the list. Singly linked lists are efficient for insertion and deletion of elements at the beginning of the list or after a given node, but they have slower access times than arrays or other data structures for accessing elements at a specific index. Singly linked lists are commonly used in algorithms and programming languages, and they are the simplest form of linked list.

## ALX TASKS
This project, we are tasked with coming with the following tasks

Task 0: Write a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list.

Task 1: Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list.

Task 2: Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list.

Task 3: Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list.

Task 4: Write a function that frees a listint_t list.

Task 5: Write a function that frees a listint_t list.

Task 6: Write a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head nodeâ€™s data (n).

Task 7: Write a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.

Task 8: Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list.

Task 9: Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.

Task 10: Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list.

## advanced tasks
Task 11: Write a function that reverses a listint_t linked list.

Task 12: Write a function that prints a listint_t linked list.

Task 13: Write a function that frees a listint_t list.

Task 14: Write a function that finds the loop in a linked list.
