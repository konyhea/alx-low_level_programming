Function pointers in programming languages like C and C++ are pointers that point to functions. They are used to pass functions as arguments to other functions, to dynamically select a function at runtime, and to implement callbacks.
return-type (*ptr_name)(arg_type1, arg_type2, ..., arg_typeN); Function pointers are a powerful feature of C and C++. They allow you to pass functions as arguments, dynamically select functions at runtime, and implement callbacks. Understanding how to use them is essential for writing robust and flexible code.

The following tasks where done in this particular projects
task 0 - Write a function that prints a name.

task 1 - ever get it done
mandatory
Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

task 2 - Write a function that searches for an integer.

task 3 - Write a program that performs simple operations.

task 4 - Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.
